Whether keys are used to authenticate users or to encrypt data, they are the secret value upon which
wireless networks rely. A key can be common to several users. For wireless networks, the key can be stored 
on the AP and shared among those who are allowed to access the network via this AP.

A common key can be used in three ways:

- For authentication only: only users who have the key can access the network, but their subsequent communication 
is sent unencrypted
- For encryption only: any user can assosiate to the WLAN, but only users who have a valid key can send are receive
traffic to and from other users of the AP
- For authentication and encryption: the key is used for both authentication and encryption
