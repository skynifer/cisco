Central Web Authentication: Lesson 1: Web Authentication Overview


Web Auth Overview


- Tupically used for guests
- Provides network access after authentication via HTTP/HTTPS
- Users are automatically redirected to authentication portal
- May be used in 802.1X environmental as a fallback method
- Works in both wired and wirelass envinmental

Portal and URL redirection 


- Central Web Auth
- Device Registration (Web Auth)
- BYOD On-boarding
  - Certificate Provisioning
  - Supplicant configuration
- Client software provisioning
- Posture Discovery / Assessment
- My device portal 
- External Web Page


Web Auth Process

1. Initial authorization assignment restricts traffic
   - Only web authentication permitted
   - Other traffic is redirected to PSN web portal
2. After successful authentication, appropriate network access is provided



 Web Authentication and Guest Services
 
 
 - Guest services
   - Feature needed to provision and manage guest user accounts
   - Independent from web authentication
   - Extension to the web authentication to provide overall guest authentication solution
 - Elements of the guest services
   - Guests
   - Sponsors
   - Guest User Portal
   - Sponsor Portal
  
  
Central Web Authentication: Lesson 2: Web Authentication Scenarios


- Cental Web Auth 
  - Users authenticated centrally ISE PSN, CoA
- Local Web Auth (SW or WLC)
- Device Registration
  - Enable onboarding of users own device
  - Consecutive user auth no needed
  - Authentication by MAB

  
Central Web Authentication: Lesson 3: Central WebAuth Config Procedure


1. Client connects to NAD. May or may not have 802.1X supplicant
2. NAD initiates an access request
   - MAB request (no 802.1X supplicant)
   - Regular user access request (802.1X supplicant)
3. ISE configured continue operation
   - Upon "MAB failure" or "User not found"
   - To allow the central web authentication process to proceed
4. ISE sends access-accept with URL-redirect to CWA service on PSN



  Cental WebAuth Operation (Cont.)
  
5. User attempts to connect to any URL
6. NAD pushes redirect URL to client
7. Client browser sends redirected traffic to PSN
8. Guest service authenticates the user
9  Guest service sends a CoA to the NAD
10. NAD applies new authorization settings



 Cental WebAuth Config Procedure
 
1. Enable session services for Guest and Sponsor Portals
2. Set (verify) ISE authentication policy (MAB) to continue after failure
3. Configure authorization profile for web authentication 
4. Apply authorization profile to authorization policy
   1. One policy to redirect initially
   2. One policy to permit access when authenticated
5. Configure WLC for central web authentication
6. Configure WLC ACL for centralized web authentication


 Step 1: Enable Session Services
 
 - Session services checkbox enables Guest and Sponsor service portal
 - RADIUS servers used for CWA of a NAD must be PSNs with session services enabled
 
 Step 2: MAB Authentication set to continue
 - This is default setting from ISE 1.3
 - Fail-open authentication rule
 - Must "Continue" if user not found (it means successfully pass authentication and move to authorization)
 
 
 
 
 Central Web Authentication: Lesson 4: Central WebAuth Config Procedure - Continued

 Step 3: Configure WebAuth Authorization Profile
 
 - authorization profile configured for web authentication  (ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT)
 - References a named ACL that is configured on the NAD
   - Definition on switch (HTTP/HTTPS) destination will and will not be redirected 
   - Redirect all traffic to WebAuth page (ISE)
   
 Step 4: Apply Authorization Profile to Policy
 
 - Apply WebAuth Profile to authorization rule
   - Use the buit-in WebAuth rule
   - Create new for the purpose
   - Use the default rule as an catch all
   
 Step 5: Configure WLC for Central WebAuth
 
   - In the WLAN setting, enable MAC filtering, AAA override, RADIUS-NAC
   - Configure RADIUS authentication and accounting
   
 Step 6: Configure WLC for Cental WebAuth
 
  - WLC redirect ACL is a regular wireless ACL:
    - Premit statements for allowed traffic like DNS and traffic to PSN (10.154.200.203)
	- Traffic implicitly denied is re-directed to the redirect URL
