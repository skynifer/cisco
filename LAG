Configuration 

Step 1

Connect only the gig port to the switch. Configure the switch port which goes to the AP gig port i.e gig 1/0/10 (in this case)
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/10
switchport mode access
end

Step 2

Once the AP registers to the WLC, run the following commands from the WLC command line.

config ap lag-mode support enable 
(This will NOT result in a reboot of the APs that support LAG)


Step 3

For load balancing on the LAG ports to the AP and the controller, the switch should support load balancing on the layer 4 (L4) 
source and destination ports. Run the following command from the switch config mode.


port-channel load-balance src-dst-port

If one doesn't configure L4 port load balancing (for example when using a switch model which does not support this feature) 
then the port channel will still come up but all the traffic will go through the same port. 
One will not have 2 gigabits of speed but there will be redundancy.


Step 4

Now configure both the switch ports (g1/0/10 and g1/0/9) into etherchannel and plug the AP aux port into the other switch port i.e. g1/0/9. At this point we have both the AP gig and aux port connected to the switch.

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/10
switchport mode access
channel-group 1 mode active
end

 

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/9
switchport mode access
channel-group 1 mode active
end

 

interface Port-channel1
switchport mode access
end


If you want to use mode "ON" instead of LACP, use command "channel-group 1 mode on" under the switch ports.

Any further configuration change (moving to trunk, adding supported vans) has to be done through the portchannel 
interface from now on.

Important note

The 3800 AP primary port is mGig capable (up to 5Gbps) while the AUX port is a standard Gigabit port. This means that if 
you set up LAG on a mGig capable switch and 3802 access point, the portchannel will be suspended due to the difference in speeds :

*Nov 21 20:37:04.987: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39, changed state to down
*Nov 21 20:37:07.122: %EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Te1/0/39 is not compatible with Te1/0/40 


Verify
The state of the LAG configuration on the controller and AP can be seen using the following commands on the controller:

show ap lag-mode
LAG-Mode Support ................................ Enabled



show ap config general <ap-name>

AP LAG Configuration Status ..................... Enabled
LAG Support for AP .............................. Yes

show lag summary
show configuration

If you see the LAG support staying as "No", it might be because the DTLS data encryption is enabled. LAG is not supported along with DTLS data encryption.


The successful formation of LAG between AP and the switch can be seen using the following commands on the switch:

sh etherchannel summary
Number of channel-groups in use: 1
Number of aggregators: 1
