                                                 Best Practices Recommendations
 - Infrastructure
 - Mesh
 - Security
 - Wireless / RF

------------------------------------------------------- Infrastructure ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. Enable High Availability (AP and Client SSO)

{ A direct physical connection between Active and Standby Redundant Ports or Layer 2 connectivity is required
to provide stateful redundancy within or across datacenters }

2. Enable AP Failover Priority

{ • Wireless > Access Points > Global Configurations
  • Wireless > Access Points > All APs -> AP_NAME > High Availability }
  
3. Enable AP Multicast Mode

{ Controller > General > AP Multicast Mode }
// Network infrastructure must provide multicast routing between management interface subnet and AP subnet 
   Forward multicast traffic to Access Points instead of sending unicast messages to each individual AP //

4. Enable Multicast VLAN

{ WLANs > WLAN Name > General }

// To limit the multicast on the air to a single copy on a predefined multicast VLAN //


5. Enable Pre-image download

{ Wireless > Global Configurations > AP Image Pre-download }

6. Enable AVC

{ Wireless > Application Visibility and Control > AVC Profiles }

// Classifies applications, provides real-time analysis, and allows users to drop or mark data. Peruser,
per-device granularity for control //

7. Enable NetFlow

{ Wireless > Netflow > Exporter > Create ‘New’ }

// NetFlow export to Cisco Prime or third party network management tool //

8. Enable Local Profiling (DHCP and HTTP)

{ WLANs > Edit > WLAN_NAME > Advanced }

// Client devices can be profiled based on their manufacturer and operating system //

9. Enable NTP

{ Controller > NTP > Keys
  Controller > NTP > Server

10. Modify the AP Re-transmit Parameters

{ Wireless > Access Points > Global Configuration }

// Allows user to customize the way APs attempt to join a WLC.
Increase count and interval for larger latency links like FlexConnect and satellite links //
Number of times the AP will
try to join the WLC (3-8)

11. Enable FastSSID change

{ Controller > General } 
Allows clients to move faster between SSIDs, by not clearing the client entry

12. Enable Per-user BW contracts
 
{ WLANs > Edit ‘WLAN_NAME’ > QoS } Enforces limits on non-mission critical clients Limit data rates for Guest
and Contractor accounts

13. Enable Multicast Mobility

Controller > Multicast
Controller > General

// Allows clients to announce messages to all mobility peers, instead of individual WLCs, benefiting
time, CPU usage, and network utilization. Multicast routing between controllers  //

14. Enable Client Load balancing

{ WLANs > Edit “WLAN-NAME” > Advanced }

// Balances the number of clients connect to a WLAN between multiple APs
Not suitable for Voice, Low Density and single AP deployments like hotspots // 

15. Disable Aironet IE

{ WLANs > Edit “WLAN-NAME” > Advanced }

// Can cause compatibility issues with some types of wireless clients
Enable for WGB and Cisco voice. Optional for CCX based clients //

16. Same Vitrual IP if same mobility name

{ Controller > Interfaces > virtual }

// Inter-controller roaming can appear to work, but the hand-off does not complete and the
client loses connectivity when DHCP renew is performed if DHCP proxy enabled //



--------------------------------------------- --------- MESH -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Set Bridge Group Name
2. Set Preferred Parent
3. Multiple Root APs in each BGN
7. Set Backhaul rate to "Auto"
8. Set Backhaul Channel Width to 40/80 MHz
9. Backhaul Link SNR > 25 dBm
10. Avoid DFS channels for Backhaul
11. External RADIUS server for Mesh MAC Authentication
12. Enable IDS
13. Enable EAP Mesh Security Mode

------------------------------------------------------ Security --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. Enable 802.1x and WPA/WPA2 on WLAN

WLANs > Edit ‘WLAN_NAME’ > Security

Provides greater network security on WLAN using 802.1x authentication

2. Enable 802.1x authentication for AP

Wireless > Access Points > Global Configurations

Provides greater network security by enabling 802.1x on the switch port where AP is
connected. Not supported for Mesh deployments

3. Change advance EAP timers

4. Enable SSH and disable telnet

Management > Telnet–SSH
Disable Telnet and enable SSH as the default option

Provides greater security by allowing secure access and denying unencrypted access

5. Disable Management Over Wireless

Management > Mgmt Via Wireless

6. Disable WiFi Direct

WLANs > WLAN Name > Advanced

Prevent security hole if the device is connected to both the infrastructure and a
Personal Area Network (PAN) at the same time. Will break Android devices

7. Peer-to-peer blocking
8. Secure Web Access (HTTPS)

Management > HTTP-HTTPS

Provides greater security by allowing secure access

9. Enable User Policies
10. Enable Client exclusion policies

Security > Wireless Protection Policies > Client Exclusion Policies

Enable exclusion policies to prevent the network from Assoc/Auth failure attacks.
Disable for Voice deployments

11. Enable rogue policies and Rogue Detection RSSI

Security > Wireless Protection Policies > Rogue Policies > General > Low

The Rogue Detection Security Level should be set at a minimum to “low”

12. Strong password Policies
13. Enable IDS
14. BYOD Timers 

Security > AAA > RADIUS > Authentication 
BYOD: Radius Timeout >=5 sec

To prevent pre-mature failover since the default of 2 seconds is generally low for ISE as ISE relies
on backend databases for user lookups and group fetches. Too high causes queue issues on WLC

BYOD : Disable Aggressive Failover 

config radius aggressive-failover disable command to disable the
aggressive failover feature
show radius summary to check the status of this feature
Only fails over to the next AAA server if there are three consecutive clients that
fail to receive a response from the RADIUS server
BYOD : Disable Aggressive Failover
97
In some circumstances it can cause the WLC to pre-maturely mark ISE dead in times of
high load and cause additional load on ISE 

                                          << FlexConnect Best Practices >>
                                          
1.  Enable FlexConnect Groups

Wireless > FlexConnect Groups > Edit “Groupname”


Allow users to assign specific APs to groups with set configurations, OKC/CCKM key
caching for Voice, Local RADIUS server configuration, consistent WLAN mappings


2.  CCKM/OKC Key sharing, consistent WLAN mappings
3.  Enable Smart AP Image Upgrade

Wireless > Flexconnect Groups > Edit “Groupname” > Image Upgrade Tab


Avoids downloading multiple copies of the Access Point software over the slow WAN link
to the remote site, reduces service downtime and reduces risk of download failure


4.  FlexConnect Group level VLAN Configuration
--------------------------------------------------- WIRELESS / RF ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 

1. Disable 802.11b data rates

Wireless > 802.11b/g/n > Network

Management frames sent at 62 lowest mandatory rate - slows down the entire cell

2. Restrict number of WLAN below 4

3. Enable channel bonding – 40 or 80 MHz

Wireless > 802.11a/n/ac > RRM > DCA

40/80MHz wide channels in the 5GHz space can 2x/4x the amount of user data than can be
transmitted. For extreme HD deployments use 20 MHz channels to keep cell size small

Select the widest Channel Width with:
• Highest Client Data Rates
• Lowest Channel Utilization per Radio
• Minimize Data Retries / CRC errors
• On the 5GHz Band
While avoiding:
• Rogue APs
• CleanAir Interferers

4. Enable BandSelect

WLANs > Edit “WLAN-NAME” > Advanced

Allows dual-band clients to move to the less congested 5GHz band
Not recommended for Voice deployments 

• Today
• 802.11 data rates
• TPC Power Threshold and Min max Power settings
• DCA
• Coverage hole algorithm settings
• High Density – HDX configurations RX_SOP, Client Limit, Mcast data rate
• Client Distribution


5. Use RF Profiles and AP Groups

• RF Profiles work in Conjunction with AP Groups (beginning in release 7.2)
• You can create separate RF profiles for both 2.4 and 5 GHz
• 1 profile for each band (802.11a/802.11b) can be assigned to an AP group

6. Enable RRM (DCA & TPC) to be auto


7. Enable Auto-RF group leader selection

Wireless > Network Profile

Sets pre-defined RF parameters depending on “Client” Density and Traffic Type

Client Density specific pre-built RF profiles for 2.4 GHz and 5GHz Bands – to be used
with AP Groups 

8. Enable Cisco CleanAir and EDRRM

Wireless > 802.11a/n/ac or 802.11b/g/n > RRM > DCA 

EDRRM triggers RRM to run when an access point detects a certain level of interference

Wireless > 802.11a/n/ac or 802.11b/g/n > CleanAir

CleanAir identifies non-WIFI interferers and generates interferer and air quality reports

9. Enable Noise & Rogue Monitoring on all channels

Wireless > 802.11a/n/ac or 802.11b/g/n > RRM > General

Wireless > 802.11a/n/ac > RRM > DCA
Wireless > 802.11b/g/n > RRM > DCA

To avoid frequent changes in DCA due to varying Load conditions

10. Enable DFS channels
11. Avoid Cisco AP Load
